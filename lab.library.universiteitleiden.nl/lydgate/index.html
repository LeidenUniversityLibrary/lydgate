                        or John Lydgate, Verses on the Kings of England (to Henry VI)
                     </h1>


                     <h2>
                        A. Content and form</h2>
                     <h3>
                        A1. Content</h3>
                     <p>
                        This poem consists of fifteen brief poetic stanzas about the kings of England, from William the
                        Conqueror to Henry VI, thus portraying the English monarchy from the eleventh to the fifteenth
                        century. The stanzas describe the kings’ heritage (name and previous king), their deeds − both
                        good and bad, how many years they ruled, their death, and their burial place. For example, in
                        the stanza about William Rufus on f. 92v, line one and two: “Nexte in ordre // bi succession /
                        will(i)am Rufus his sone crowned kyng” concern his heritage. Line three to five tell about his
                        deeds, here negative ones: “which to godward had no devocion / distroyed cherchis // off new
                        (and) olde beldyng / to make a forest // plesant for hu(n)tyng”. The last two lines state the
                        number of years he ruled, “xiiij yer // bar his crowne in deede,” and his burial place, “buryed
                        at wenchester // the crownycle ye may †rede†”.
                     </p>
                     <h3>
                        A2. Themes
                     </h3>
                     <p>
                        Not surprisingly, the main theme of the poem is the English monarchy. In general, it is a praise
                        of kings. The more recent the king is to Lydgate, the more positive the description seems to be.
                        Perhaps the author felt that critiquing older kings was less dangerous.
                        One of the themes present in this poem is the War of the Roses (1455 − 1485), the dispute
                        between the House of Lancaster and the House of York about who possessed the rightful claim on
                        the English throne. Lydgate had strong ties to the Lancastrian kings Henry V and VI, as these
                        were his patrons, and this is also evident in his description of these kings in the poem. In the
                        poem, Henry VI’s description states: “henry the vi: bi iust title, bi grace of crist jhesus,
                        regne her in his riht” (f. 94r). Thus, according to Lydgate, he is indeed the rightful king. All
                        Lancastrians are depicted as good kings, which also shows Lydgate’s loyalties.
                        Another source of turbulence during the reigns of the last few kings in the poem is the Hundred
                        Years’ War (1337 −1453), a conflict between the English and French monarch over the rule of
                        France. This can also be traced back in the poem. For example, Edward III is said to be
                        “Enheritour off ffrance” and “gat Caleys // bi his prudent device” (f. 93v). Henry IV and Henry
                        V are both reported to have reigned “with werre (and) gret syknesse” and “in pees (and) werr”
                        respectively (f. 94r). Lydgate thus strongly supports the English claim in this conflict.
                        The conflict with France might also have infused a sense of nationalism with regard to the
                        English kings, even though nationalism saw dips during this period. The kings that were involved
                        in the Hundred Years’ War are mostly described positively. For example Henry IV is described as
                        “A ffamous knyht,” while Henry V is depicted as “Able to stond a mong the worth nyne” (f. 94r).
                        However, Lydgate does not seem to have a particular opinion about French-Norman kings, who are
                        judged on their actions instead of their nationality, such as in William Rufus’ case.

                        A3. Genre
                     </h3>
                     <p>
                        This poem can be identified as a chronicle, which provides simple summaries of historical events
                        in chronological order. Historical writing was not unknown to medieval literature. Some examples
                        of other historical writing are Geoffrey Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae (1136) and
                        Layamon’s Brut (1190 − 1215). In the later Middle Ages, “a new type of vernacular chronicle
                        gained prominence: the verse chronicle.” Lydgate’s poem could be said to be part of this new
                        type. These verses “focused more on detail, elaborate descriptions, and the development of
                        individual styles.” However, different from these works, this short poem contains only
                        rudimentary information on the kings. The stanzas are just seven lines (in contrast: Brut has
                        16,095 lines in total) of enumerating facts about kings, with only their major deeds being
                        mentioned.

                        A4. Formal aspects</h3>
                     <p>
                        The poem contains seven lines per stanza and fifteen stanzas, thus 105 lines in total. It is
                        written in rhyme royal, which was introduced to English poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer. This entails
                        decasyllabic verse lines, with a rhyme scheme of a-b-a-b-b-c-c.
                        One of the scribe’s characteristics is to place two slashes halfway lines. In general, the
                        scribe uses double slashes either in between five syllables on each side or with four syllables
                        before and six syllables after. Thus, the slashes indicate a caesura. This can be linked to the
                        influence of French poetry, which also used caesuras, on Lydgate. For example, French
                        alexandrine poetry has twelve syllables in a line with a caesura in the middle, creating two
                        half-lines of six syllables.
                        Throughout the poem, the metre often does not seem fully consistent, based on spelling, but
                        could be regularised with alternative pronunciations, as the result of elision, synizesis,
                        apocope and syncope. However, sometimes the poem appears to have some irregularities which are
                        not easily resolved through the postulation of these phonetic processes. For example, the line
                        “at langley buried so stood the cas” (f. 93v) seems to have only nine spelled syllables, while
                        “On Tho(m)as lancastre // bi deth he tok vengau(n)ce” (f. 93v) appears to have thirteen spelled
                        syllables. If these are indeed cases of irregularity, it seems more likely that these are the
                        result of copying errors on the part of the scribes.
                        Although sometimes the metre is a little irregular, it is a useful aid in deducing pronunciation
                        of particular words − providing examples here from the first stanza of f. 92v. For instance, the
                        French city Caen is spelled as “Cane”, but through the metre it is clear that the pronunciation
                        with regard to syllables is likely to be similar how it would be nowadays, namely /kan/ rather
                        than /´ka -nə/. Furthermore, the i in both “mencion” and “possession” is pronounced as a
                        separate syllable /i/. The same goes for final -e’s, which sometimes seem to be pronounced
                        according to the metre, such as in: “As bokis oldë // makë mencion”. The rhyme scheme, too, is
                        useful to deduce which words were meant to rhyme. Through the rhyme scheme, for example, it may
                        be argued that “cronyclar” should perhaps be cronycleer as it rhymes with “yeer”.

                     <p>
                        The text’s origin most probably lies in England, because of the English nationalistic character
                        of the poem, its Middle English language, and the manuscript witnesses’ origins in England. If
                        the poem was indeed written by Lydgate, it may have been composed in Bury St Edmunds, the abbey
                        where he spent most of his life, or in Essex, where he lived between 1421 and 1431, depending on
                        the exact date of the poem.
                        The poem was definitely written after Henry VI became king of England in 1421 and of France in
                        1422. The text does not mention his death in 1471 or his deposition from the throne in 1461.
                        Lydgate died around 1451, so if he wrote it, it would be between 1421 and 1451. The scholar
                        Mooney dates the earliest exactly datable extant manuscript (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley
                        686) containing this poem to 1429-1430 from internal evidence in the rest of the manuscript.
                        Therefore it is likely that the poem was written between 1422 and 1429.

                        The author is said to be John Lydgate in all modern scholarship.
                        There is no intended audience found in the text, but it could be meant for everyone learning
                        history in an informal setting. According to Mooney, the poem was to be read out loud, perhaps
                        to children learning history and/or grammar. The poem also has a political purpose, to glorify
                        the monarchy of England − in case of Lydgate, his royal patron. The DIMEV supports this by
                        stating that the poem is written for Lydgate’s patron King Henry VI.

                     <p>
                        Although the text seems to have been very popular given its wide dissemination, not much has
                        been written about this text in modern scholarship. This might be due to the fact that Lydgate
                        is a less popular author nowadays.
                        Linne Mooney discusses this text alongside another anonymous verse about kings to study how this
                        text relates to its political context and its continued use as a form of political propaganda.
                        Mooney has written another article on this text, together with Adrian C. Barbrook, Christopher
                        J. Howe and Matthew Spencer. They have conducted a stemmatic analysis of the text in all
                        manuscript and print witnesses, using both manual and digital techniques. MS Leiden is
                        categorised in a group with eight others, mostly manuscripts from the fifteenth century, which
                        share common variants. Leiden’s poem is closely connected to Lansdowne 699, which Van Dorsten
                        already indicated for another text of Lydgate in the Leiden MS.
                        C. F. Bühler discusses the date of the same poem in MS Ashmole 59, which has the name of Edward
                        IV added at the end of the poem. He compares this particular manuscript to an earlier version of
                        the text, namely in Dublin Trinity College MS 516, which does not contain the additional stanza.
                        This article contains an elaborate enumeration of variation between the two manuscripts. Bühler
                        however does not seem to be overly fond of the poem, as he describes it as “fifteen practically
                        worthless stanzas”.
                        Van Dorsten only names the poem “The Kings of England Sithen William Conquerour” without
                        mentioning additional information, not even an author. He does however sketch the Leiden
                        manuscript context for the poem. Further information on Lydgate can be found in James Simpson’s
                        article, who discusses Lydgate’s characteristics as an author and advocates further scholarly
                        research on his texts.

                     <p>
                        Orthography/Spelling:
                        There are some noteworthy characteristics with regard to spelling in this poem. For example,
                        there is an occasional use of the thorn character (þ), which is rather archaic. One example is
                        “þe Scottis krong” (f. 93v). Other occurrences are found in the margins. Furthermore, the scribe
                        of this poem has a particular tendency to use double ff’s, even though the letter is not meant
                        as a capital F.
                        Particularly interesting in relation to spelling are names of kings and place names. For
                        example, throughout the poem, the name Henry is spelled as “herry”. Some place names are also
                        spelled differently than one would expect, such as the mysterious “Bwme,” likely to refer to
                        Bohemia and “Angoye,” for modern day Anjou (f. 93v, f. 93r).
                        Finally, another special phenomenon occurs in “thempresse” and “therchebisshop” (f. 92v, f.
                        93r). Both these instances are contracted forms as a result of elision. The vowel of the
                        determiner “the” is absorbed by the initial vowel of empresse and erchebisshop respectively. It
                        is likely that this spelling is the result of fitting in with the metre.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Morphology:
                        As regards morphology, the poem does not seem to reveal any unusual characteristics. The
                        personal pronouns appear to have no irregularities. Furthermore, the poem uses -th endings in
                        third person singular contexts: “to whom god hath yeuen sou(er)en sufficiau(n)ce” (f. 94r).
                        Thus, the poem does not resemble a Northern dialect with -s endings. Finally, during the Middle
                        English period, the -e endings slowly began to disappear in spoken form, but sometimes remained
                        in spelling variants. Throughout the poem, nouns, adjectives, and past-tense verbs sometimes
                        have a final -e. It is debatable whether these were pronounced, as there are some instances
                        whereby the final -e is needed to get the correct number of syllables in the line. Three such
                        examples are “bookis oldë”, “regnedë” and “burydë” (f. 92v).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Syntax:
                        One particular characteristic of the poem’s style relates to syntax. In this poem, the stanzas
                        consist of a summation of facts about kings. The style of the language clearly resembles this.
                        The particular way in which the individual facts are enumerated may be characterised by the term
                        asyndeton, a series of related clauses that lack coordinating conjunctions, such as and. For
                        example, in the first stanza, the audience is informed that William the Conqueror “mad kyng
                        [...] put out herald // tooke possession / bar his crowne [...] buried at Cane” (f. 92v). The
                        five different phrases here are not coordinated.
                        Further adding to the style of this poem as a enumeration of facts, is the way in which tensed
                        verbs occasionally lack a direct grammatical subject. For example, in the tensed verbs in the
                        first stanza as quoted above have no direct grammatical subject like he. They all still
                        retrospectively refer to William. Occasionally in the poem, a personal pronoun he is used, but
                        often no grammatical subject is given.
                        Additionally, in some cases passive constructions using a past participle lack a tensed
                        auxiliary. This happens twice in the first stanza: “mad kyng” and “buried at Cane” (f. 92v).
                        Both these instances lack a form like was.
                        Finally, the poem also sometimes shows an unusual word order. One example is “affter ward to
                        wenchester his bodi caried †was†” (f. 93v). It is possible that this word order is there to fit
                        in with the metre of the poem and to have “was” rhyme with “cas” (f. 93v).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Vocabulary:
                        The poem occasionally uses French loanwords. For instance “alyaunce” and “enheritour” are both
                        originally French words (f. 93v). The use of French words is not surprising, given the great
                        influence of French on the English language, but, still, the use of French loanwords shows the
                        aureate style of the poet. Furthermore, the rich style that was associated with French loanwords
                        also fits the subject matter, as this poem celebrates the rule of kings.

                        Dialect:
                        From the spelling of certain words, some suggestions may be made as to the dialect this poem
                        represents. First of all, the -th ending in makith and seyth clearly indicate that this text is
                        not a Northern text, but a Southern one. Words with a velar fricative /x/ such as knyht, myht,
                        riht are all spelled with h rather than gh, which, according to Horobin, points to a Suffolk
                        dialect and Lydgate’s own particular use. Furthermore, the spelling of ageyn and nat reveal
                        influences of Samuel’s type III (Chaucerian) standard.
                        Based on the eLALME data, the usage of ageyn, nat, buryede, buryed, callid, and heold
                        individually all suggest a Southern dialect rather than a Northern one. However, other spelling
                        features, like hooly, seyth, and sorwe individually seem point north of London at least. It
                        might, of course, be the case that these features result from the work of different scribes.
                        Together, these features combined in eLALME give seven locations whose linguistic profiles
                        strongly correspond to that of this text. One of these is located on the border between Suffolk
                        and Norfolk, where ageyn, nat and sorwe are frequently attested. Two other locations also lie in
                        counties adjacent to Suffolk, where these same words are used, though less frequently, while one
                        is located just west of Norfolk, where nat and sorwe are frequently attested, with seyth only
                        occasionally indicated. The other three locations are scattered throughout the country, but all
                        in the South. Thus, based on eLALME and these features, the text might resemble an Eastern
                        dialect. This ties in with Lydgate’s own Suffolk origin, but also with the name of one of the
                        manuscript’s first owners, John Kyng of Dummowe, as Dunmow lies in Essex.

                     from the seventeenth century. Additionally, there are three print versions of the text. This shows
                     the text’s prolonged popularity and use.

                        D2. Witness-specific information
                     </h2>
                     <p>
                        There are many different versions of this poem in the extant manuscripts. Several manuscripts
                        other than Leiden contain additional stanzas, added to either the beginning or the end,
                        concerning other kings, for example the reigns between Alfred the Great and Harold Godwinson, or
                        the subsequent reigns after 1461. These stanzas are not written by Lydgate, but do show the
                        continued use of the poem for political ends.

                        D3. Scribe </h2>
                     <p>
                        Scribe I of Leiden wrote this text. This scribe is English, from the second half of the
                        fifteenth century, who writes in a cursive hand. He was responsible for most of the texts in
                        this manuscript, including Lydgate’s Fall of Princes − another royally-themed poem.
                     </p>
                      <h2>
                        D4. How was it read/used?</h2>
                     <p>
                        Study has found no notes added to the poem in Leiden. However, there are a few reading aids
                        provided, such as the Latin title at the top, which has been added to the manuscript by the
                        Dutch scholar Franciscus Junius, a sixteenth/seventeenth-century owner. Furthermore, the kings’
                        names in the margin serve as helpful aids that indicate which king is dealt with in the stanza.
                        These names seem to be the same handwriting as the main text, but they could have been added
                        later as well. These additions would clarify the text more and serve a learners audience.

                        A1. Content</h3>
                     <p>
                        This poem consists of fifteen brief poetic stanzas about the kings of England, from William the
                        Conqueror to Henry VI, thus portraying the English monarchy from the eleventh to the fifteenth
                        century. The stanzas describe the kings’ heritage (name and previous king), their deeds − both
                        good and bad, how many years they ruled, their death, and their burial place. For example, in
                        the stanza about William Rufus on f. 92v, line one and two: “Nexte in ordre // bi succession /
                        will(i)am Rufus his sone crowned kyng” concern his heritage. Line three to five tell about his
                        deeds, here negative ones: “which to godward had no devocion / distroyed cherchis // off new
                        (and) olde beldyng / to make a forest // plesant for hu(n)tyng”. The last two lines state the
                        number of years he ruled, “xiiij yer // bar his crowne in deede,” and his burial place, “buryed
                        at wenchester // the crownycle ye may †rede†”.
                     </p>
                     <h3>
                        A2. Themes
                     </h3>
                     <p>
                        Not surprisingly, the main theme of the poem is the English monarchy. In general, it is a praise
                        of kings. The more recent the king is to Lydgate, the more positive the description seems to be.
                        Perhaps the author felt that critiquing older kings was less dangerous.
                        One of the themes present in this poem is the War of the Roses (1455 − 1485), the dispute
                        between the House of Lancaster and the House of York about who possessed the rightful claim on
                        the English throne. Lydgate had strong ties to the Lancastrian kings Henry V and VI, as these
                        were his patrons, and this is also evident in his description of these kings in the poem. In the
                        poem, Henry VI’s description states: “henry the vi: bi iust title, bi grace of crist jhesus,
                        regne her in his riht” (f. 94r). Thus, according to Lydgate, he is indeed the rightful king. All
                        Lancastrians are depicted as good kings, which also shows Lydgate’s loyalties.
                        Another source of turbulence during the reigns of the last few kings in the poem is the Hundred
                        Years’ War (1337 −1453), a conflict between the English and French monarch over the rule of
                        France. This can also be traced back in the poem. For example, Edward III is said to be
                        “Enheritour off ffrance” and “gat Caleys // bi his prudent device” (f. 93v). Henry IV and Henry
                        V are both reported to have reigned “with werre (and) gret syknesse” and “in pees (and) werr”
                        respectively (f. 94r). Lydgate thus strongly supports the English claim in this conflict.
                        The conflict with France might also have infused a sense of nationalism with regard to the
                        English kings, even though nationalism saw dips during this period. The kings that were involved
                        in the Hundred Years’ War are mostly described positively. For example Henry IV is described as
                        “A ffamous knyht,” while Henry V is depicted as “Able to stond a mong the worth nyne” (f. 94r).
                        However, Lydgate does not seem to have a particular opinion about French-Norman kings, who are
                        judged on their actions instead of their nationality, such as in William Rufus’ case.

                        A3. Genre
                     </h3>
                     <p>
                        This poem can be identified as a chronicle, which provides simple summaries of historical events
                        in chronological order. Historical writing was not unknown to medieval literature. Some examples
                        of other historical writing are Geoffrey Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae (1136) and
                        Layamon’s Brut (1190 − 1215). In the later Middle Ages, “a new type of vernacular chronicle
                        gained prominence: the verse chronicle.” Lydgate’s poem could be said to be part of this new
                        type. These verses “focused more on detail, elaborate descriptions, and the development of
                        individual styles.” However, different from these works, this short poem contains only
                        rudimentary information on the kings. The stanzas are just seven lines (in contrast: Brut has
                        16,095 lines in total) of enumerating facts about kings, with only their major deeds being
                        mentioned.

                     <h3>
                        A4. Formal aspects</h3>
                     <p>
                        The poem contains seven lines per stanza and fifteen stanzas, thus 105 lines in total. It is
                        written in rhyme royal, which was introduced to English poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer. This entails
                        decasyllabic verse lines, with a rhyme scheme of a-b-a-b-b-c-c.
                        One of the scribe’s characteristics is to place two slashes halfway lines. In general, the
                        scribe uses double slashes either in between five syllables on each side or with four syllables
                        before and six syllables after. Thus, the slashes indicate a caesura. This can be linked to the
                        influence of French poetry, which also used caesuras, on Lydgate. For example, French
                        alexandrine poetry has twelve syllables in a line with a caesura in the middle, creating two
                        half-lines of six syllables.
                        Throughout the poem, the metre often does not seem fully consistent, based on spelling, but
                        could be regularised with alternative pronunciations, as the result of elision, synizesis,
                        apocope and syncope. However, sometimes the poem appears to have some irregularities which are
                        not easily resolved through the postulation of these phonetic processes. For example, the line
                        “at langley buried so stood the cas” (f. 93v) seems to have only nine spelled syllables, while
                        “On Tho(m)as lancastre // bi deth he tok vengau(n)ce” (f. 93v) appears to have thirteen spelled
                        syllables. If these are indeed cases of irregularity, it seems more likely that these are the
                        result of copying errors on the part of the scribes.
                        Although sometimes the metre is a little irregular, it is a useful aid in deducing pronunciation
                        of particular words − providing examples here from the first stanza of f. 92v. For instance, the
                        French city Caen is spelled as “Cane”, but through the metre it is clear that the pronunciation
                        with regard to syllables is likely to be similar how it would be nowadays, namely /kan/ rather
                        than /´ka -nə/. Furthermore, the i in both “mencion” and “possession” is pronounced as a
                        separate syllable /i/. The same goes for final -e’s, which sometimes seem to be pronounced
                        according to the metre, such as in: “As bokis oldë // makë mencion”. The rhyme scheme, too, is
                        useful to deduce which words were meant to rhyme. Through the rhyme scheme, for example, it may
                        be argued that “cronyclar” should perhaps be cronycleer as it rhymes with “yeer”.

                     <p>
                        The text’s origin most probably lies in England, because of the English nationalistic character
                        of the poem, its Middle English language, and the manuscript witnesses’ origins in England. If
                        the poem was indeed written by Lydgate, it may have been composed in Bury St Edmunds, the abbey
                        where he spent most of his life, or in Essex, where he lived between 1421 and 1431, depending on
                        the exact date of the poem.
                        The poem was definitely written after Henry VI became king of England in 1421 and of France in
                        1422. The text does not mention his death in 1471 or his deposition from the throne in 1461.
                        Lydgate died around 1451, so if he wrote it, it would be between 1421 and 1451. The scholar
                        Mooney dates the earliest exactly datable extant manuscript (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley
                        686) containing this poem to 1429-1430 from internal evidence in the rest of the manuscript.
                        Therefore it is likely that the poem was written between 1422 and 1429.

                     <p>
                        The author is said to be John Lydgate in all modern scholarship.
                        There is no intended audience found in the text, but it could be meant for everyone learning
                        history in an informal setting. According to Mooney, the poem was to be read out loud, perhaps
                        to children learning history and/or grammar. The poem also has a political purpose, to glorify
                        the monarchy of England − in case of Lydgate, his royal patron. The DIMEV supports this by
                        stating that the poem is written for Lydgate’s patron King Henry VI.

                        B3. Overview of scholarship
                     </h3>
                     <p>
                        Although the text seems to have been very popular given its wide dissemination, not much has
                        been written about this text in modern scholarship. This might be due to the fact that Lydgate
                        is a less popular author nowadays.
                        Linne Mooney discusses this text alongside another anonymous verse about kings to study how this
                        text relates to its political context and its continued use as a form of political propaganda.
                        Mooney has written another article on this text, together with Adrian C. Barbrook, Christopher
                        J. Howe and Matthew Spencer. They have conducted a stemmatic analysis of the text in all
                        manuscript and print witnesses, using both manual and digital techniques. MS Leiden is
                        categorised in a group with eight others, mostly manuscripts from the fifteenth century, which
                        share common variants. Leiden’s poem is closely connected to Lansdowne 699, which Van Dorsten
                        already indicated for another text of Lydgate in the Leiden MS.
                        C. F. Bühler discusses the date of the same poem in MS Ashmole 59, which has the name of Edward
                        IV added at the end of the poem. He compares this particular manuscript to an earlier version of
                        the text, namely in Dublin Trinity College MS 516, which does not contain the additional stanza.
                        This article contains an elaborate enumeration of variation between the two manuscripts. Bühler
                        however does not seem to be overly fond of the poem, as he describes it as “fifteen practically
                        worthless stanzas”.
                        Van Dorsten only names the poem “The Kings of England Sithen William Conquerour” without
                        mentioning additional information, not even an author. He does however sketch the Leiden
                        manuscript context for the poem. Further information on Lydgate can be found in James Simpson’s
                        article, who discusses Lydgate’s characteristics as an author and advocates further scholarly
                        research on his texts.

                     <p>
                        Orthography/Spelling:
                        There are some noteworthy characteristics with regard to spelling in this poem. For example,
                        there is an occasional use of the thorn character (þ), which is rather archaic. One example is
                        “þe Scottis krong” (f. 93v). Other occurrences are found in the margins. Furthermore, the scribe
                        of this poem has a particular tendency to use double ff’s, even though the letter is not meant
                        as a capital F.
                        Particularly interesting in relation to spelling are names of kings and place names. For
                        example, throughout the poem, the name Henry is spelled as “herry”. Some place names are also
                        spelled differently than one would expect, such as the mysterious “Bwme,” likely to refer to
                        Bohemia and “Angoye,” for modern day Anjou (f. 93v, f. 93r).
                        Finally, another special phenomenon occurs in “thempresse” and “therchebisshop” (f. 92v, f.
                        93r). Both these instances are contracted forms as a result of elision. The vowel of the
                        determiner “the” is absorbed by the initial vowel of empresse and erchebisshop respectively. It
                        is likely that this spelling is the result of fitting in with the metre.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Morphology:
                        As regards morphology, the poem does not seem to reveal any unusual characteristics. The
                        personal pronouns appear to have no irregularities. Furthermore, the poem uses -th endings in
                        third person singular contexts: “to whom god hath yeuen sou(er)en sufficiau(n)ce” (f. 94r).
                        Thus, the poem does not resemble a Northern dialect with -s endings. Finally, during the Middle
                        English period, the -e endings slowly began to disappear in spoken form, but sometimes remained
                        in spelling variants. Throughout the poem, nouns, adjectives, and past-tense verbs sometimes
                        have a final -e. It is debatable whether these were pronounced, as there are some instances
                        whereby the final -e is needed to get the correct number of syllables in the line. Three such
                        examples are “bookis oldë”, “regnedë” and “burydë” (f. 92v).

                        Syntax:
                        One particular characteristic of the poem’s style relates to syntax. In this poem, the stanzas
                        consist of a summation of facts about kings. The style of the language clearly resembles this.
                        The particular way in which the individual facts are enumerated may be characterised by the term
                        asyndeton, a series of related clauses that lack coordinating conjunctions, such as and. For
                        example, in the first stanza, the audience is informed that William the Conqueror “mad kyng
                        [...] put out herald // tooke possession / bar his crowne [...] buried at Cane” (f. 92v). The
                        five different phrases here are not coordinated.
                        Further adding to the style of this poem as a enumeration of facts, is the way in which tensed
                        verbs occasionally lack a direct grammatical subject. For example, in the tensed verbs in the
                        first stanza as quoted above have no direct grammatical subject like he. They all still
                        retrospectively refer to William. Occasionally in the poem, a personal pronoun he is used, but
                        often no grammatical subject is given.
                        Additionally, in some cases passive constructions using a past participle lack a tensed
                        auxiliary. This happens twice in the first stanza: “mad kyng” and “buried at Cane” (f. 92v).
                        Both these instances lack a form like was.
                        Finally, the poem also sometimes shows an unusual word order. One example is “affter ward to
                        wenchester his bodi caried †was†” (f. 93v). It is possible that this word order is there to fit
                        in with the metre of the poem and to have “was” rhyme with “cas” (f. 93v).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Vocabulary:
                        The poem occasionally uses French loanwords. For instance “alyaunce” and “enheritour” are both
                        originally French words (f. 93v). The use of French words is not surprising, given the great
                        influence of French on the English language, but, still, the use of French loanwords shows the
                        aureate style of the poet. Furthermore, the rich style that was associated with French loanwords
                        also fits the subject matter, as this poem celebrates the rule of kings.

                        Dialect:
                        From the spelling of certain words, some suggestions may be made as to the dialect this poem
                        represents. First of all, the -th ending in makith and seyth clearly indicate that this text is
                        not a Northern text, but a Southern one. Words with a velar fricative /x/ such as knyht, myht,
                        riht are all spelled with h rather than gh, which, according to Horobin, points to a Suffolk
                        dialect and Lydgate’s own particular use. Furthermore, the spelling of ageyn and nat reveal
                        influences of Samuel’s type III (Chaucerian) standard.
                        Based on the eLALME data, the usage of ageyn, nat, buryede, buryed, callid, and heold
                        individually all suggest a Southern dialect rather than a Northern one. However, other spelling
                        features, like hooly, seyth, and sorwe individually seem point north of London at least. It
                        might, of course, be the case that these features result from the work of different scribes.
                        Together, these features combined in eLALME give seven locations whose linguistic profiles
                        strongly correspond to that of this text. One of these is located on the border between Suffolk
                        and Norfolk, where ageyn, nat and sorwe are frequently attested. Two other locations also lie in
                        counties adjacent to Suffolk, where these same words are used, though less frequently, while one
                        is located just west of Norfolk, where nat and sorwe are frequently attested, with seyth only
                        occasionally indicated. The other three locations are scattered throughout the country, but all
                        in the South. Thus, based on eLALME and these features, the text might resemble an Eastern
                        dialect. This ties in with Lydgate’s own Suffolk origin, but also with the name of one of the
                        manuscript’s first owners, John Kyng of Dummowe, as Dunmow lies in Essex.

                     The text survives in 36 manuscripts, thus, as Mooney points out, suggesting its popularity at the
                     time. The oldest manuscript is Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 686 (c. 1430 − 1440). Of the 36
                     extant manuscripts, 32 are from the fifteenth century, three from the sixteenth century and one
                     from the seventeenth century. Additionally, there are three print versions of the text. This shows
                     the text’s prolonged popularity and use.

                        There are many different versions of this poem in the extant manuscripts. Several manuscripts
                        other than Leiden contain additional stanzas, added to either the beginning or the end,
                        concerning other kings, for example the reigns between Alfred the Great and Harold Godwinson, or
                        the subsequent reigns after 1461. These stanzas are not written by Lydgate, but do show the
                        continued use of the poem for political ends.

                        Scribe I of Leiden wrote this text. This scribe is English, from the second half of the
                        fifteenth century, who writes in a cursive hand. He was responsible for most of the texts in
                        this manuscript, including Lydgate’s Fall of Princes − another royally-themed poem.

                     <p>
                        Study has found no notes added to the poem in Leiden. However, there are a few reading aids
                        provided, such as the Latin title at the top, which has been added to the manuscript by the
                        Dutch scholar Franciscus Junius, a sixteenth/seventeenth-century owner. Furthermore, the kings’
                        names in the margin serve as helpful aids that indicate which king is dealt with in the stanza.
                        These names seem to be the same handwriting as the main text, but they could have been added
                        later as well. These additions would clarify the text more and serve a learners audience.
